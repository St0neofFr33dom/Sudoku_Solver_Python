# Sudoku_Solver_Python


This was my last project before starting School of Code

I was happy that I got the logic working, it was able to complete easy and intermediate puzzles (and some hard ones)

Looking back at it, I realised that I only ever created functions where code would have been repeated otherwise.

I have since learned that functions are also good and compatmentalising code, reducing cognitive overload.

The importance of it can be seen in the shorter_box file, where the code is gets heavily nested and is difficult to read.

I have since made another repo where I wrote the sudoku solver in javascript: https://github.com/St0neofFr33dom/Sudoku_solver_javascript

In this repo I broke the logic down into functions, making the code much tidier. I also wrote test files for those functions
